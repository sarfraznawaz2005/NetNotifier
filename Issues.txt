We need to fix these issues:

"
IP:        139.5.117.26
Uptime:    00:00:04
Latency:   500ms
Drops:     8
Up:        99.900000000000006%
"

1. See what cause is causing "99.900000000000006%" even though we have Round in place.
2. Even though drops are 8, we are still getting "99.9" success, we should make sure we also put "Drops" in formula for calculating "Up" percentage.
3. Update DEFAULT_INTERVAL, DEFAULT_PING_TIMEOUT, MIN_INTERVAL, MAX_INTERVAL, MIN_PING_TIMEOUT, MAX_PING_TIMEOUT with sane defaults. One of the isue I am having is that sometimes app says connection lost and very next moment, connection restored, if we have restoration in split of second, we should either discard these as disconnects or fix (prefered) what is causing this (ISSUES status) including sane defaults.
